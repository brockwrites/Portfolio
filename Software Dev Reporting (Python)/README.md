üñ•Ô∏è This folder contains Python that imports project and code repository statistics (number of merges, who merged, etc.) into Monday.com.

Though __Monday.com__ is typically considered a project management tool, it has excellent reporting capabilities.
- **GerritGitLabToMondayComReport.py:** Get GitLab & Gerrit merge information and publish it to a Monday.com board.
- **InProgressProjectsBoardFromCSV.py:** Populate a Monday.com board with a project rollup (in CSV) imported from OneDrive.
