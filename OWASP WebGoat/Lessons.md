[Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YO8rsCMVUyY) & [Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5YPRhM5GyE)
Hijack a session by guessing the session cookie. Demonstrates using ***Burp > Sequencer*** tool to capture tokens and find anomalies. Also demonstrates using ***Burp > Intruder*** tool to find the login request and test different tokens.

[Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fMFLqbd0-Y) & [Walkthrough](https://hackmd.io/@DaLaw2/ByD70wAM2#Insecure-Direct-Object-References)
Covers authenticating as a regular user, but then gaining access to data from other user accounts. Uses Burp Repeater, Proxy, & Intruder (with 'numbers' payload).
### A1: Missing Function Level Access Control
[Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-MTbhfXbgg) Page HTML (viewed in Chrome DevTools, for example) could hide elements that make a web app susceptible to hacking. These elements might be links to administrative functions. By modifying requests (Burp Repeater) and revising based on responses, you can gather useful information for hacking.
### A1: Spoofing an Authentication Cookie
[Video] TBD
