# Public Portfolio for Brock Price

👋 Thanks for visiting! I'm Brock, a **Software Analyst** with a deep interest in **Cyber Security** and **Technical Documentation**. 🚀

🌐 As a **Software Analyst**, I specialize in Software Testing, Administration and Deployment and bring **15+ years** of hands-on experience to the table. My journey in the world of technology has led me to explore and master various aspects of software, and I'm always excited about learning and staying ahead in this ever-evolving landscape.

🔧 In my coding adventures, I often find myself immersed in **JavaScript**, **Python**, **Docker**, and I'm always exploring innovative ways to solve problems. I'm always learning, too, and I hope that my shared experiences can help others learn, too.

🌱 Beyond the code, I'm a Soccer Dad and a bookworm. These interests help fuel my creativity and provide a creative outlet.

📫 Let's connect and collaborate! Feel free to explore my repositories. If you have a project or idea you'd like to discuss, don't hesitate to reach out. Together, let's build something amazing! 🚀
